Welcome to the Task Management Application!

Below is a list of the different pages, along with a brief description of each.  In order to navigate between the different pages, use the Nav Bar at the top of each page (there is a dropdown menu for mobile users).

## Home

Here you will find a brief summary of each of the core functions of the application. You can create your own list of tasks and expertly manage them with our Delete, Edit, and Complete functions. There is also a View function for viewing details of a task, such as what it pertains, any start and end dates, and the status of the task.

## Register

![task_manager_register](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31b9c3db-2788-42a5-b5a7-da5cfb6636f6)

In order to use the application, you will have to register an account, with a username and password. The account will be linked to an email (with the option to add your phone number as well), as well as your preferred contact method.  Registration is very simple and only takes a few moments.

## Login

![task_manager_login](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c765194-73a6-4eb4-9477-2264f4c2ecd8)

Once you've registered an account, you will have to log into it in order to use the features. This is for your security and privacy.

## Dashboard

![task_manager_dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60ae2337-22d9-4c64-a85f-3bab78b9564e)

The Dashboard is where you can perform the Delete and Edit functions.  Deleting a task will NOT complete it--it only removes it from the applictation.  

## Add a Task

![task_manager_addtask](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b795baad-83bd-4624-8b1e-b68d390f98d3)

If you wish to add a task, you may do so at the Add a Task page.  All that is required is some details about your task, and the Start Date.  If there is an End Date that you are aware of, you are encouraged to enter that as well, but it is not required at this stage.

## Task Details

![task_manager_details](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2528c53-9009-47b9-a7bb-041239daabd7)

The options to Complete and View Tasks are both listed in the Task Details page.  It is reccomended that, once you have selected the task, you use the View Details button to view the task and make sure it is complete before clicking the Mark as Complete button.
